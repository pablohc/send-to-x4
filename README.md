  ## Workflow (Important)
  
  Send to X4 works best as a simple two-step ritual:
  
  1. ✅ Load the article while connected to the internet  
  2. ✅ Switch to the X4 WiFi hotspot  
  3. ✅ Open the popup and send  
  4. ❌ Do not refresh the page while connected to the X4 hotspot

  ## Troubleshooting
  
  ### "No article detected"
  - The page must contain enough long-form text
  - Try waiting a few seconds for dynamic pages to load
  - Some highly dynamic sites may not extract well
  
  ### "Not connected to X4"
  - Make sure you are connected to the X4 WiFi hotspot
  - Check your **Settings** block in the popup to ensure the **IP Address** matches your device or firmware type.
  - Open the device IP (e.g., `http://192.168.4.1/`) in your browser to verify connectivity.
  
  ### "Extension context invalidated"
  - Reload the extension from `chrome://extensions/`
  - Reload the article page while on internet WiFi
  - Switch back to the X4 hotspot and try again

  ## Known Limitations
  
  - Text-only (images are temporarily disabled)
  - Requires manual WiFi switching
  - Works best on long-form, reading-oriented pages
  - Not a read-later service or cloud sync tool
